This table defines every possible visit, its properties, frequency, and associated branding. The Applicability column dictates which type of period the visit should be generated for.

3. Visit Generation Algorithm
This section specifies the exact algorithm to be implemented in a function like generateVisitsForPeriod(period, restaurants). This function is responsible for creating a fresh list of visit objects for the state.visits array.

3.1. Function Signature
Inputs: The function must accept the target period (e.g., "P7") and the user's list of restaurants (e.g., [{ id: 'rest-0', name: 'CAVA Springfield' }, ...]).
Output: The function must return an array of visit objects, each with a unique ID, ready to be stored in the application state. Each object should contain properties for id, type, duration, location, required, scheduled, and remaining.
3.2. Step-by-Step Logic
Initialize an empty array to hold the new visits for the specified period.
Determine Period Type: Check if the input period exists in the defined list of QRA Periods.
Generate Per-Restaurant Visits:
Initiate a loop that iterates through each restaurant object in the provided restaurants array.
Inside the loop, for each restaurant:
If the period is a QRA Period:
Create and add a QRA visit object for this restaurant.
If the period is a Standard Period:
Create and add a Coaching Visit object for this restaurant.
Regardless of period type:
Create and add a Guest Experience visit object for this restaurant.
Create and add a Cash Audit visit object for this restaurant.
Create and add a GM Impact visit object for this restaurant.
Generate Per-Garden Visits:
After the restaurant loop has completed, add the visits that occur only once per period, regardless of the number of restaurants.
Create and add one Station Training Workshop visit object. The location for this visit should be set to "Per Garden".
Create and add one Competency Champion visit object. The location for this visit should be set to "Per Garden".
Return the Final Array: Return the completed array of all generated visit objects for the period.
